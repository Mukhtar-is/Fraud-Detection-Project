# Fraud-Detection-Project
In this project, I built machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset where fraud accounts for only 0.2% of cases. The challenge was not achieving high accuracy which is trivial in such imbalanced data but designing models that maximize recall while maintaining practical precision.
